Question 8
----------

**This question involves the use of simple linear regression on the `Auto` data set.**

We start off by loading the data and taking a look at its structure:

``` r
data("Auto")
names(Auto)
```

    ## [1] "mpg"          "cylinders"    "displacement" "horsepower"  
    ## [5] "weight"       "acceleration" "year"         "origin"      
    ## [9] "name"

``` r
str(Auto)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    392 obs. of  9 variables:
    ##  $ mpg         : num  18 15 18 16 17 15 14 14 14 15 ...
    ##  $ cylinders   : num  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ...
    ##  $ displacement: num  307 350 318 304 302 429 454 440 455 390 ...
    ##  $ horsepower  : num  130 165 150 150 140 198 220 215 225 190 ...
    ##  $ weight      : num  3504 3693 3436 3433 3449 ...
    ##  $ acceleration: num  12 11.5 11 12 10.5 10 9 8.5 10 8.5 ...
    ##  $ year        : num  70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 ...
    ##  $ origin      : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    ##  $ name        : Factor w/ 304 levels "amc ambassador brougham",..: 49 36 231 14 161 141 54 223 241 2 ...

### Part 8a

**Use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with mpg as the response and horsepower as the predictor. Use the summary() function to print the results. Comment on the output.**

``` r
mpg_hp_lm <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
summary(mpg_hp_lm)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
    ## -13.5710  -3.2592  -0.3435   2.7630  16.9240 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept) 39.935861   0.717499   55.66   <2e-16 ***
    ## horsepower  -0.157845   0.006446  -24.49   <2e-16 ***
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## 
    ## Residual standard error: 4.906 on 390 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.6059, Adjusted R-squared:  0.6049 
    ## F-statistic: 599.7 on 1 and 390 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

**For example:**

1.  Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response?
2.  How strong is the relationship between the predictor and the response?
3.  Is the relationship between the predictor and the response positive or negative?
4.  What is the predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of 98? What are the associated 95% confidence and prediction intervals?

The relation between the predictor `horsepower` and response `mpg` is negative, as shown by the estimated coefficient **-0.1578447** which is less than 0.

Based on the output generated by the linear model, the p-value associated with the coefficient for `horsepower` is extremely low. We can conclude that there is a **significant negative** relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg`.

The strength of the relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg` is indicated by the *Pearson correlation coefficient*. For a simple linear regression model, the correlation coefficient can be found by taking the *negative* square root (since the linear coefficient is negative) of the Multiple R-squared value in the output:

``` r
-sqrt(summary(mpg_hp_lm)$r.squared)
```

    ## [1] -0.7784268

Alternatively, the correlation coefficient can be found using the `cor()` function:

``` r
cor(Auto$mpg, Auto$horsepower)
```

    ## [1] -0.7784268

The magnitude of the correlation coefficient suggests a **moderately strong relationship** between `horsepower` and `mpg`.

We can find out the predicted values of `mpg` and their intervals using the `predict()` function.
The following code attempts to predict `mpg` and the 95% confidence intervals for a given set of `horsepower` values:

``` r
predict(mpg_hp_lm, newdata = data.frame(horsepower = 98), 
        interval = "confidence")
```

    ##        fit      lwr      upr
    ## 1 24.46708 23.97308 24.96108

We change the `interval` parameter if we want to calculate the 95% *prediction* intervals:

``` r
predict(mpg_hp_lm, newdata = data.frame(horsepower = 98), 
        interval = "prediction")
```

    ##        fit     lwr      upr
    ## 1 24.46708 14.8094 34.12476

Based on the output, for `horsepower` of 98, the predicted `mpg` value would be about **24.47** (miles per gallon); the 95% confidence interval would be approximately **(23.97, 24.96)** and the 95% prediction interval would be approximately **(14.81, 34.12)**.
(The confidence interval reflects the uncertainty surrounding the predicted `mpg` averaged over multiple vehicles; the prediction interval reflects the uncertainty surrounding the `mpg` predicted for a particular vehicle, which also takes into the account the irreducible error ϵ.)

### Part 8b

**Plot the response and the predictor. Use the abline() function to display the least squares regression line.**

``` r
plot(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto, pch = 1, cex = 0.6,
     main = "Miles per gallon against Horsepower",
     xlab = "Engine Horsepower", ylab = "Miles per Gallon")
abline(mpg_hp_lm)
```

![](chapter3_applied_files/figure-markdown_github/q8%20plot-1.png)

### Part 8c

**Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the least squares regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit.**

``` r
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(mpg_hp_lm)
```

![](chapter3_applied_files/figure-markdown_github/q8%20diagnostic%20plot-1.png)

A brief description of the diagnostic plots shown above:

-   The top-left plot is a residual plot, which plots the residuals *e<sub>i</sub> = y<sub>i</sub> - ŷ<sub>i</sub>* against the fitted values.
-   The top-right plot is a quantile-quantile plot (QQ plot) of the residuals to check if the residuals are normally distributed.
-   The bottom-left plot is a scale-location plot that examines if residuals are spread equally along the range of predictors and can be used to check the assumption of equal variance (homoscedascity).
-   The bottom-right plot is a plot of residuals against leverage, to check for outliers with significant leverage that would heavily influence the regression model.

From the diagnostic plots, we can see the following issues:

-   The plot of residuals against fitted values appear to exhibit a pattern which suggests that our linear model is not a good fit for the relationship between `horsepower` and `mpg`: the pattern in the residuals may be due to a non-linear relationship that the model does not capture.

Question 9
----------

This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the `Auto` data set.

### Part 9a

**Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the data set.**

``` r
plot(Auto)
```

![](chapter3_applied_files/figure-markdown_github/q9%20scatterplot-1.png)

### Part 9b

**Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function cor() . You will need to exclude the `name` variable, which is qualitative.**

``` r
auto_noname <- Auto[, -9] # new data frame that excludes name variable (9th column)
cor(auto_noname)
```

### Part 9c

**Use the lm() function to perform a multiple linear regression with mpg as the response and all other variables except name as the predictors. Use the summary() function to print the results.**

``` r
auto_multiple_lm <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = auto_noname)
(auto_mlm_summary <- summary(auto_multiple_lm)) # assigns and prints the summary
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = auto_noname)
    ##

    ## Residual standard error: 3.328 on 384 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.8215, Adjusted R-squared:  0.8182 
    ## F-statistic: 252.4 on 7 and 384 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

Comment on the output. For instance:

1.  Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
2.  Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
3.  What does the coefficient for the year variable suggest?

The F-statistic for the overall model is very high, suggesting that there is a relationship between the predictors and the response (rejecting the null hypothesis that all of the predictors are not related to the response)

Based on the p-values for the t-statistic, we think the following predictors may have a statistically significant relationship with the response:

-   `displacement`
-   `weight`
-   `year`
-   `origin`

The coefficient for year is 0.751, which implies that the average miles per gallon increases by this amount every year when all other predictors are held constant.

### Part 9d

**Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the linear regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit. Do the residual plots suggest any unusually large outliers? Does the leverage plot identify any observations with unusually high leverage?**

``` r
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(auto_multiple_lm)
```

![](chapter3_applied_files/figure-markdown_github/q9%20diagnostic%20plot-1.png)

-   The residuals-fitted plot shows a slight pattern which suggests the presence of relationships not accounted for by our model (such as non-linear predictors).
-   There are some observations with particularly large residuals (especially index 327 which is marked on all four plots).
-   Index 14 is a high-leverage observation but the residual is not considered significant enough to severely influence the regression model.

### Part 9e

**Use the `\*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction effects. Do any interactions appear to be statistically significant?**

For example, we may want to find out if there may be a significant interaction between `displacement` and `horsepower` (in other words, does the relationship between `displacement` and `mpg` change depending on the `horsepower` of the vehicle?) We use the `update()` and `summary()` functions to refit the model:

``` r
summary(
    update(auto_multiple_lm, ~ . + weight:horsepower)
    )
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = mpg ~ cylinders + displacement + horsepower + weight + 
    ##     acceleration + year + origin + horsepower:weight, data = auto_noname)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max 
    ## -8.589 -1.617 -0.184  1.541 12.001 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##                     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept)        2.876e+00  4.511e+00   0.638 0.524147    
    ## cylinders         -2.955e-02  2.881e-01  -0.103 0.918363    
    ## displacement       5.950e-03  6.750e-03   0.881 0.378610    
    ## horsepower        -2.313e-01  2.363e-02  -9.791  < 2e-16 ***
    ## weight            -1.121e-02  7.285e-04 -15.393  < 2e-16 ***
    ## acceleration      -9.019e-02  8.855e-02  -1.019 0.309081    
    ## year               7.695e-01  4.494e-02  17.124  < 2e-16 ***
    ## origin             8.344e-01  2.513e-01   3.320 0.000986 ***
    ## horsepower:weight  5.529e-05  5.227e-06  10.577  < 2e-16 ***

    ## 
    ## Residual standard error: 2.931 on 383 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.8618, Adjusted R-squared:  0.859 
    ## F-statistic: 298.6 on 8 and 383 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

The interaction term `horsepower:weight` appears to be significant based on its p-value; in addition the R-squared value has also risen by about .04, which suggests that our new model might be a slightly better fit than the model used in Part 9c.

It's also worth noting that `horsepower` itself is also now a significant predictor, whereas `displacement` is no longer significant under this model.

<!-- test combinations of one interaction term, then spread the table -->
### Part 9f

**Try a few different transformations of the variables, such as log(X), √X, X<sup>2</sup> . Comment on your findings.**

We can refit the model a quadratic transformation term `horsepower^2^` to observe the fit of the new model:

``` r
summary(
    update(auto_multiple_lm, ~ . + I(horsepower^2))
    )
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = mpg ~ cylinders + displacement + horsepower + weight + 
    ##     acceleration + year + origin + I(horsepower^2), data = auto_noname)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

    ## acceleration    -0.3305981  0.0991849  -3.333 0.000942 ***
    ## year             0.7353414  0.0459918  15.989  < 2e-16 ***

    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.8552, Adjusted R-squared:  0.8522 
    ## F-statistic: 282.8 on 8 and 383 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

The transformed predictor appears to be significant as well, with the R-squared value increasing by about 0.3.

Question 10
-----------

*This question should be answered using the `Carseats` data set.*

We load the `Carseats` data set and examine the structure:

``` r
data("Carseats")
str(Carseats)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    400 obs. of  11 variables:
    ##  $ Sales      : num  9.5 11.22 10.06 7.4 4.15 ...
    ##  $ CompPrice  : num  138 111 113 117 141 124 115 136 132 132 ...
    ##  $ Income     : num  73 48 35 100 64 113 105 81 110 113 ...
    ##  $ Advertising: num  11 16 10 4 3 13 0 15 0 0 ...
    ##  $ Population : num  276 260 269 466 340 501 45 425 108 131 ...
    ##  $ Price      : num  120 83 80 97 128 72 108 120 124 124 ...
    ##  $ ShelveLoc  : Factor w/ 3 levels "Bad","Good","Medium": 1 2 3 3 1 1 3 2 3 3 ...
    ##  $ Age        : num  42 65 59 55 38 78 71 67 76 76 ...
    ##  $ Education  : num  17 10 12 14 13 16 15 10 10 17 ...
    ##  $ Urban      : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 ...
    ##  $ US         : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ...

We can see that our variables of interest can be classified as quantitative and categorical:

-   `Sales` - Unit sales (in thousands) at each location, quantitative response
-   `Price` - Price company charges for car seats at each site, quantitative predictor
-   `Urban` - A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in an urban or rural location (Yes = 2, No = 1), qualitative predictor
-   `US` - A factor with levels No and Yes to indicate whether the store is in the US or not (Yes = 2, No = 1), qualitative predictor

### Part 10a

*Fit a multiple regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`, and `US`.*

``` r
carseats_multiple_lm <- lm(Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)
summary(carseats_multiple_lm)
```

The contrasts for the qualitative predictors `Urban` and `US` are as shown below:

``` r
contrasts(Carseats$Urban)
```

    ##     Yes
    ## No    0
    ## Yes   1

``` r
contrasts(Carseats$US)

### Part 10b

*Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!*

-   The coefficient for `Price` is -0.05446. This means that for every dollar the company charges for the car seats, the average unit sales **decreases** by about **54.46 units**.
-   The coefficient for `UrbanYes` is -0.02192. This means that on average, stores in urban locations sell **21.92 less units** than stores in rural locations.
-   The coefficient for `US` is 1.201. This means that on average, stores in the United States sell **1201 more units** than stores outside of the United States.

### Part 10c

*Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.*

<!-- x_i_ =\begin{cases}1 & \text{if }i\text{th store is urban}\\0 & \text{if }i\text{th store is rural}\end{cases}  -->

### Part 10d

*For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>j</sub> = 0?*

We can reject the null hypothesis for the predictors `Price` and `US`, based on the p-values for these two predictors being very low. In other words, we infer that there is a significant relationship between `Price` and `Sales`, as well as `US` and `Sales`.

### Part 10e

*On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.*

``` r
carseats_smaller_lm <- lm(Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
summary(carseats_smaller_lm)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
    ## -6.9269 -1.6286 -0.0574  1.5766  7.0515 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept) 13.03079    0.63098  20.652  < 2e-16 ***
    ## Price       -0.05448    0.00523 -10.416  < 2e-16 ***

    ## Residual standard error: 2.469 on 397 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.2393, Adjusted R-squared:  0.2354 
    ## F-statistic: 62.43 on 2 and 397 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

### Part 10f

*How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?*

    ##                            Model   RSE Rsquared
    ## 1 Model with Price, Urban and US 2.472   0.2393
    ## 2        Model with Price and US 2.469   0.2393

Both models exhibit similar levels of RSE (residual squared error), and explain about 24% of the variance in `sales`.

### Part 10g

*Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).*

``` r
confint(carseats_smaller_lm)
```

    ##                   2.5 %      97.5 %
    ## (Intercept) 11.79032020 14.27126531
    ## Price       -0.06475984 -0.04419543
    ## USYes        0.69151957  1.70776632

### Part 10h

*Is there evidence of outliers or high leverage observations in the model from (e)?*

``` r
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(carseats_smaller_lm, id.n = 5)
```

![](chapter3_applied_files/figure-markdown_github/q10%20diagnostic%20plots-1.png)

From the residuals-fitted values plot, we see that there are some outliers (indices 51 and 377 show the greatest residuals), however most of these outliers do not have significant leverage.
From the residuals-leverage plot, there is one high-leverage observation but it does not have a residual that is large enough to exert significant influence on the model.
